    "class": "SYN Scan",
    "analysis": "The classifier has classified this instance as **SYN Scan**. The top features contributing to this classification are:\n\n• **Bwd Header Len**: This feature is the most important, with an importance score of **4.910742282867432**. This suggests that the length of the backward header plays a significant role in distinguishing **SYN Scan** instances.\n• **Flow Pkts/s**: This feature has an importance score of **0.6509057283401489**, indicating that the number of flow packets per second is also relevant in this classification.\n• **Flow Duration**: With an importance score of **0.5643200278282166**, the duration of the flow in microseconds is another important feature in this classification.\n• **Fwd Header Len**: The total bytes used for headers in the forward direction, with an importance score of **0.5427594780921936**, is also a significant factor.\n• **Bwd Pkts/s**: The number of backward packets per second, with an importance score of **0.4441956877708435**, is another important feature in this classification.\n• **Flow IAT Mean**: The mean time between two packets sent in the flow, with an importance score of **0.4382604956626892**, is also relevant.\n• **Bwd IAT Max**: The maximum time between two packets sent in the backward direction, with an importance score of **0.33023613691329956**, is another important feature.\n• **Bwd IAT Tot**: The total time between two packets sent in the backward direction, with an importance score of **0.31872886419296265**, is also significant.\n• **Bwd IAT Min**: The minimum time between two packets sent in the backward direction, with an importance score of **0.25014567375183105**, is another important feature.\n• **Flow IAT Max**: The maximum time between two packets sent in the flow, with an importance score of **0.2451673299074173**, is also relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, the classifier has classified this instance as **SYN Scan** based on the combination of these features, with **Bwd Header Len** being the most important factor."
