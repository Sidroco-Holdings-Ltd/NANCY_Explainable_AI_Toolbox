    "class": "TCP Scan",
    "analysis": "The instance was classified as **TCP Scan** based on the following SHAP values:\n\n• **Bwd Header Len** is the most important feature, with an importance score of **4.74**, indicating that it has a significant impact on the classification. This feature measures the total bytes used for headers in the backward direction, which is relevant for identifying TCP scans.\n• **Flow IAT Mean** has an importance score of **1.02**, indicating that it also plays a significant role in the classification. This feature measures the mean time between two packets sent in the flow, which can help identify patterns in the network traffic.\n• **Flow Duration** has an importance score of **0.91**, indicating that it is also relevant for the classification. This feature measures the duration of the flow in microseconds, which can help identify the length of the scan.\n• The other features have lower importance scores, ranging from **0.29** to **0.43**, indicating that they have a smaller impact on the classification.\n\nOverall, the classification of the instance as **TCP Scan** is primarily driven by the **Bwd Header Len**, **Flow IAT Mean**, and **Flow Duration** features, which are all related to the characteristics of the network traffic."
