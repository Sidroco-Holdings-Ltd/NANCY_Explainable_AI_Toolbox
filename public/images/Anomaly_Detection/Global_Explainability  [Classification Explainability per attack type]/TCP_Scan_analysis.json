    "class": "TCP Scan",
    "analysis": "The instance was classified as **TCP Scan** based on the following SHAP values:\n\n• **Bwd Header Len**: This feature represents the total bytes used for headers in the backward direction. It is important because it can indicate an attempt to establish a connection, which is characteristic of a TCP scan.\n• **Flow IAT Mean**: The mean time between two packets sent in a flow is another crucial feature. A sudden increase in this value could indicate that the network is being probed for vulnerabilities.\n• **Flow Duration**: The duration of the flow in microseconds is also significant, as it can help identify long-lasting connections or suspicious activity patterns.\n• **Bwd IAT Tot**: This feature represents the total time between two packets sent in the backward direction. It is important because it can indicate a pattern of frequent data transmission, which could be indicative of a scan.\n• **Bwd IAT Min**: The minimum time between two packets sent in the backward direction is another crucial feature. A sudden decrease in this value could indicate that the network is being probed for vulnerabilities.\n• **Flow IAT Max**: The maximum time between two packets sent in a flow is also significant, as it can help identify long-lasting connections or suspicious activity patterns.\n• **Bwd Pkts/s**: The number of backward packets per second is another crucial feature. A sudden increase in this value could indicate that the network is being probed for vulnerabilities.\n• **SYN Flag Cnt**: The number of packets with SYN flags is also significant, as it can help identify attempts to establish a connection, which is characteristic of a TCP scan.\n\nIn conclusion, these features are crucial in predicting the associated class of a TCP scan because they provide insights into the network's behavior and can help identify suspicious activity patterns that may indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities. By understanding the importance of these features, we can better protect our systems from potential threats."
