    "class": "Outage Risk",
    "analysis": "The classifier has classified this instance as **Outage Risk** due to the following factors:\n\n• **tx_pkts**: This feature represents the number of transmitted packets in the downlink direction. It is important because it indicates the amount of data being sent from the network to the user's device. A higher value of this feature could indicate a higher risk of network congestion or outage.\n• **dl_cqi**: This feature stands for Channel Quality Indicator for downlink. It measures the quality of the downlink channel, which is essential for understanding the user's experience with the network. A lower value of this feature could indicate poor signal strength, leading to a higher risk of network congestion or outage.\n• **sum_granted_prbs**: This feature represents the sum of granted Physical Resource Blocks in the downlink direction. It is important because it indicates the amount of resources allocated to the user's device for data transmission. A higher value of this feature could indicate a higher risk of network congestion or outage due to the increased demand for resources.\n• **sum_requested_prbs**: This feature represents the sum of requested Physical Resource Blocks in the downlink direction. It is important because it indicates the user's device's demand for resources, which can affect the network's performance and availability. A higher value of this feature could indicate a higher risk of network congestion or outage due to the increased demand for resources.\n• **dl_buffer**: This feature represents the buffer size in the downlink direction. It is important because it indicates the amount of data that can be stored in the network's buffer before being transmitted to the user's device. A lower value of this feature could indicate a higher risk of network congestion or outage due to the inability to store and transmit data efficiently.\n\nIn conclusion, these features are crucial for predicting the associated class because they provide insights into the network's performance and availability. By understanding the relationship between these features and the classifier's output, we can identify potential issues that may lead to network congestion or outages. This knowledge helps us to proactively manage network resources and improve user experience."
